A complete working environment needs more than just software.  Unfortunately,
most university labs seemed designed to make everything below difficult or
impossible to achieve.

1. Peace and quiet.
:   Study after study has proved that this has more impact on productivity than
    a fast network, a fat disk, or caffeine, but most workplaces are still too
    crowded, too noisy, and filled with too many interrupts. As mentioned
    earlier, it takes most people ten minutes to get back into a state of flow
    after being distracted, which means that half a dozen interruptions per hour
    effectively renders someone zero percent effective. I know people say, "If I
    can't overhear what other people are talking about, I might miss something
    important," but that only applies if the only people you're overhearing are
    members of your own team (and even then, it's a dubious claim).

2. A comfortable chair.
    A good chair with a firm back costs half what a mid-range laptop does. A
    full-sized keyboard (I have large hands---most laptop keyboards force me to
    bend my wrists uncomfortably) costs fifty dollars, and a lamp with a soft
    light bulb is another forty. The combination doesn't just let me program
    longer each day; it also helps ensure that I'll still be able to program
    five or ten years from now without chronic back and wrist pain. (If you have
    good arches, you may prefer a standing desk; if you have space, sitting on
    an exercise ball has been good for my abs and lets me bounce up and down
    during boring meetings.) Compare this with what's in most computer labs:
    their lighting gives glare without illumination, the dark desktops make the
    optical mice jerky, and the low-budget chairs are guaranteed to make your
    lower back ache after an hour.

3. A pad of gridded paper and several ballpoint pens.
:   I often make notes for myself when programming, or draw box-and-arrow
    diagrams of my data structures when debugging. I used to keep an editor open
    in a background window to do the former, but when my wrists started acting
    up, I discovered that taking my hands away from the keyboard for a few
    moments to scribble something down provided welcome relief. I also quickly
    discovered that the odds of me being able to read my own notes the next day
    rose dramatically if I used gridded paper to line them up.  Younger
    programmers (which from my point of view is most programmers these days)
    may prefer to use an online note-taking app or something on their phone.

4. A heavy mug for coffee or tea.
:   I don't know why, but a styrofoam cup, or a normal teacup, just isn't as
    satisfying as a little hand-sized ceramic boulder. Maybe it satisfies my
    subconscious atavistic urge to whack my computer when it misbehaves…

5. A toothbrush.
:   You'll feel better, you'll get sick less often, and your colleagues might
    stop suggesting that the team switch to virtual meetings quite as often.

6. A squirt bottle of glass cleaner and a box of kleenex.
:   I can't stand smears on my screen. They drive me nuts. Whenever I'm showing
    something to someone, and they actually *touch my screen* instead of just
    pointing, I find myself reaching for that heavy mug… Then I take a breath
    and clean my screen.

7. A rubber duck.
:   One of the creators of Unix kept a rubber duck next to his computer.
    Whenever a bug took more than a few minutes to track down, he put the duck
    on his desk and explained the problem to it. Why? Because speaking out loud
    forces you to marshal your thoughts, which in turn highlights any
    contradictions or missed steps that you hadn't noticed while everything was
    just swirling around inside your head.

8. A chess set, a deck of cards, or some knitting.
:   I'm a very bad chess player. Luckily, so are most people, so it's usually
    possible to find someone at my level for a quick game at lunch.  Other
    programmers I know play euchre, or knit---a programmers' stitch and bitch
    session can be jaw-dropping to listen to. Everyone needs to take breaks to
    re-set their brain; it's better to acknowledge this and do something social
    in the middle of the day than to say, "Must… keep…  coding…" and produce
    garbage that just has to be rewritten later.

9. A yoga mat.
:   Back when I was a part-time grad student, I had a settled routine: I brought
    three sets of gym gear to the office at the start of the week, worked out at
    lunchtime on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and took my stuff home at the
    end of the week. After two months of this, I came in to find that my
    co-workers had hung a little chandelier made of air fresheners over my
    desk. Since then, I've rented a locker at the gym, but I still try to get
    some exercise several times a week---it helps my concentration and stamina a
    lot more than any amount of coffee..

10. Pictures.
:   Everyone wants to feel at home; everyone wants to make wherever they are
    uniquely theirs. I hang a few postcards on the wall wherever I work, along
    with a photograph of my wife and daughter taken a few months after she was
    born (my daughter, that is), just to remind me what's really important.
