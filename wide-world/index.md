### Myers-Briggs and other danger signs

The <span g="myers_briggs" i="Myers-Briggs Type Indicator; pseudoscience
(Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</span> (MBTI)
advertises itself as personality profiling tool.  It is popular on dating sites
and some companies use it as part of their interview process---despite the fact
that it is complete bullshit.  Half or more of people who repeat the test within
a few weeks get a different personality classification, it fails to predict job
performance, and its categories are based on outdated (and very Western-centric)
psychological theories.  If a potential employer asks you to do it as part of
the interview process, ask them if they would like a horoscope as well.

Myers-Briggs has given the whole notion of personality profiling a bad
reputation.  Ironically, there *are* models of personality that have a
scientific basis and are repeatable and cross-cultural.  For example, the <span
g="ocean_model">OCEAN model</span> has five dimensions: Openness to experience,
Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Studies of
twins and other research has found that about half of personality variation
comes from genetics and about half from environment, and work like
<cite>Hannay2010</cite> has used this model in studies of programmers.
