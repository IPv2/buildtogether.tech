<span class="fixme"><cite>Solnit2010</cite>: we keep telling ourselves it's worse than it is</span>

You just missed an important deadline, and people are unhappy.  The sick feeling
in the pit of your stomach has turned to anger: you did *your* part, but Sylvie
didn't finish her stuff until the very last minute, which meant that no one else
had time to spot the two big mistakes she'd made.  As for Cho, he didn't deliver
at all---again.  If something doesn't change, you're going to fail this course.

Conflicts like this come up all the time.  We can deal with them in four ways:

1.  Cross our fingers and hope that things will get better on their own, even
    though they didn't the last three times.

2.  Do extra work to make up for others' shortcomings.  This strategy avoids the
    stress of confronting others in the short run, but the time for that "extra"
    has to come from somewhere.  Sooner or later, our personal lives or other
    responsibilities will suffer.

3.  Lose our temper.  People often displace anger into other parts of their
    lives: they may yell at someone for taking an extra few seconds to make
    coffee when what they really need to do is tell their teammates that they
    aren't going to miss another dinner with their family in order to clean up a
    mess that someone else made.

4.  Take constructive steps to fix the underlying problem.

Most of us find the first option easiest, even though it doesn't fix the
problem.  The fourth option is harder because we don't like confrontation.
Managed properly, though, it can be much less bruising, which means that we
don't have to be as afraid of it.  And if people believe that we will take steps
when they lie, bully, procrastinate, or do a half-assed job, they will often
avoid making it necessary.

## What to Do

<span class="fixme">write intro with forward ref to being a good ally</span>

Make sure we are not guilty of the same sin.
:   We won't get very far complaining about someone else interrupting in
    meetings if we do it just as frequently.

Check expectations.
:   Are we sure the offender knows what standards they are supposed to be meeting?
    This is where things like the team contracts described in <span
    x="teams"></span> come in handy.

Check the situation.
:   Is someone dealing with an ailing parent or immigration woes?  Do they have
    deadlines for three other projects that we don't know about?  Use open
    questions like, "Can you help me understand this?" when checking in.  This
    gives them the freedom to explain something you may not have expected, and
    avoids the pressure of being asked directly about something they don't want
    to discuss.

Document the offense.
:   Write down what the offender has actually done and why it's not good enough.
    Doing this helps us clarify what we're upset about and is absolutely
    necessary if we have to escalate.

Check with other team members.
:   Are we alone in feeling that the offender is letting the team down?  If so,
    we aren't necessarily wrong, but it'll be a lot easier to fix things if we
    have the support of the rest of the team.  Finding out who else on the team
    is unhappy can be the hardest part of the whole process, since we can't even
    ask the question without letting on that we are upset and word will almost
    certainly get back to whoever we are asking about, who might then accuse us
    of stirring up trouble.

Talk with the offender.
:   This should be a team effort: put it on the agenda for a meeting, present
    the complaint, and make sure that the offender understands it.  This is
    sometimes enough to solve the problem: if someone realizes that they're
    going to be called out for doing sloppy work, they will usually change their
    ways.

Escalate as soon as there's a second offense.
:   People who don't have good intentions count on us giving them one last
    chance after another until the project is finished and they can go suck the
    life out of their next victim.  *Don't fall into this trap.*  If someone
    stole a laptop, we would report it right away.  If someone steals time, we
    are being foolish if we give them a chance to do it again and again.

In a course project, "escalation" means "taking the issue to the instructor".
Of course, they have probably had dozens of students complain to them over the
years about teammates not doing their share, and it isn't uncommon to have both
halves of a pair say that they're doing all the work.  (This is yet another
reason to use version control: it makes it easy to check who's actually written
what.)  In order to get them to take us seriously and help us fix our problem,
we should send them an email signed by several people that describes the problem
and the steps we have already taken to resolve it.  Make sure the offender gets
a copy as well, and ask the instructor to arrange a meeting to resolve the
issue.

One technique your instructor may ask you to use in a meeting of this kind is
<span g="active_listening">active listening</span>. When one person makes a
point, the person on the other side of the issue explains it back to them, as
in, "So what I think Igor is saying is…" This confirms that the second person
has actually paid attention to what the first person said. It can also defuse a
lot of tension, since explaining your position back to you clearly forces the
other person to see the world through your eyes, if only for a few moments.

### Hitchhikers

<span g="hitchhiker">Hitchhikers</span> who show up but never actually do
anything are particularly difficult to manage, in part because they are usually
very good at appearing reasonable.  They will nod as we present our case, then
say, "Well, yes, but…" and list a bunch of minor exceptions or cases where
others on the team have also fallen short of expectations.  Tracking progress
and contributions is essential for handling them.  If we can't back up our
complaint, our instructor will likely be left with the impression that the whole
team is dysfunctional.

## Escalation

What can we do if conflict becomes more personal and heated?

1.  Be short, simple, and firm.

2.  Don't try to be funny.  It almost always backfires, or will later be used
    against us.

3.  Play for the audience.  We probably won't change the person we are calling
    out, but we might change the minds or strengthen the resolve of people who
    are observing.

4.  Pick our battles.  We can't challenge everyone, every time, without
    exhausting ourselves and deafening our audience.  An occasional sharp retort
    will be much more effective than constant criticism.

5.  Don't shame or insult one group when trying to help another.  For example,
    don't call someone stupid when what we really mean is that they're racist or
    homophobic.

[Captain Awkward][captain-awkward] has useful advice for discussions like these,
and [Charles' Rules of Argument][charles-rules] are very useful online.

Finally, it's important to recognize that good principles sometimes conflict
<cite>Berlin2000</cite>.  For example, suppose that a student has a medically
diagnosed attention disorder that requires them to talk to themselves quite
loudly while programming in order to stay focused, but other members of their
team find this very distracting.  Asking the student in question to program
somewhere else would be punishing them for something they can't control, while
asking everyone else to put on headphones would make their interaction more
difficult and their work less fun.  There might not be a solution that satisfies
everyone; in such cases, the best guide is to do the kindest thing possible.

## Irreconcilable Differences

Sometimes, it isn't just one person on the team who's a problem.  Sometimes, the
whole team is dysfunctional. In the mid-1990s, for example, I worked in a data
visualization startup. Individually, we were all smart, decent people. Put us
together, though, and somehow our personalities and IQs canceled out, leaving us
all dumb and nasty.

Instructors can allow for this by announcing at the start of the course that
teams will be dissolved and re-formed halfway through the project, *unless*
every member on the team submits a separate signed request to stay together.
There's a bit of psychology here: if people are required to ask for their team
to be dissolved, they will often think, "It's more trouble than it's worth, I'll
just put up with it." If dissolution is the default, though, then students won't
be inhibited by any stigma attached to being the one who caused trouble.

Students also usually understand that dissolving their team and forming a new
one takes time that could be invested in earning a higher grade.  In practice,
therefore, teams will usually stick together if they see that troublemakers are
actually being dealt with.
