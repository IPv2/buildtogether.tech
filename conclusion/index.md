We have come a long way since we talked about crunch mode and how to run a
meeting in <span x="important"/>.  Using feature branches, triaging issues,
designing software so that it can be tested---good developers do all of these
things, and learning how to do them yourself will help you get more done in less
time and with less pain.

But good developers know that programming well isn't enough: if you work long
hours, shut people out of discussion, or build the wrong thing, you project may
fail despite all the code you write.  You can learn how to run meetings, share
ideas, base your opinions on the best available research, and protect people's
rights in exactly the same way that you can learn how to use a debugger; I hope
you will choose to do so.

I also hope that your journey won't stop here.  Pervasive surveillance, online
harassment, radicalization, and the concentration of wealth and power in a few
unaccountable hands (or algorithms): our industry has fueled them all, and if
you think that being a programmer makes you immune to the fallout, think again.
None of us can fix this alone; if you have learned a little from this book or
your course about how to work well with others, then I hope you will choose to
use it to make the world a slightly better place.

## Ten Simple Rules for Changing the World

<blockquote markdown="1">

One reason people insist that you use the proper channels to change things is
because they have control of the proper channels and they're confident it won't
work.

--- [Jon Stone][stone-quote]

1. Be sure this is where you want to focus your efforts.
:   It's going to take years, it could well fail, and there are many other
    things you could do, so be sure this particular change is the one you want
    to fight for.

2. Ask those who will be affected.
:   *Nihil de nobis sine nobis* (nothing about us without us) is always a good
    motto, and asking for opinions often reveals potential allies.

3. Be specific.
:   Few people would argue in public against fair hiring practices, but the
    organization has to implement something specific in order for that to mean
    anything, and people very well might argue against those specifics.  You
    should therefore pick something specific and achievable and make a concrete
    plan for achieving it.  And start with whatever is likely to have broadest
    support, because success breeds success.

4. Figure out who has the power to make that change and what they care about.
:   Your neighbors don't make policy for your local public school: school board
    trustees do, so that's who you need to influence.  Help someone who wants
    the same change as you get elected, or help someone who doesn't oppose your
    change with something they care about in exchange for support for your
    cause, but whatever you do, do it for the people whose vote counts.
    Conversely, figure out who is going to be negatively impacted by the change
    you want and what you can do to help them: for example, if it's going to
    eliminate jobs, what else can those people usefully do?

5. Build alliances,
:   "I'll help you if you'll help me" makes the world go around.  It's hard when
    people want the same thing for very different reasons, but this rule is
    *not* cynical: people whose beliefs are aligned may still have different
    priorities.  (The flip side of this rule is to accept that some people will
    never be your allies: if everyone wanted it, you wouldn't have to push for
    the change.)  People who want the same thing you do, who have a high profile
    (either inside your group or externally), or who have a wide range of
    connections are all useful allies.

6. Test the waters.
:   At every stage, refine your idea and presentation in front of a small group
    first.  But remember: when done honestly, refining your idea sometimes means
    accepting that you wanted the wrong thing.  And note that it can be useful
    to ask someone to be the official skeptic: giving them a way to critique in
    private may temper their public criticism, and you just might convert them.

7. Keep it visible.
:   It's easy to start a blog and create a Twitter account, but that very ease
    has reduced these channels' impact.  Is there a newsletter you can be
    included in (which makes you look more official)?  Can you make a
    presentation as part of some other event (rather than organizing a gathering
    of your own)?  Can you get someone with a higher profile to mention what
    you're doing and point people your way?  Can you post notices in the
    lunchroom? The elevator? The washrooms? Local restaurants?  And always share
    a single point of contact that someone actually checks (frequently).

8. Collect data but tell stories.
:   Sooner or later someone is going to ask what financial impact this change is
    going to have, so be ready for that.  Data about other changes or from other
    organizations helps a lot, but data doesn't have nearly as powerful an
    impact as stories.  Don't explain what *kind* of people this will help:
    explain how it helped a specific person, or how it would make a specific
    person's life better.  And if you've never cried when telling that story,
    tell a better story.

9. Learn how to run meetings and make decisions.
:   You can get the change you want without being a great public speaker, but
    you *must* know how to run a meeting and make decisions <span
    x="important"/>.

10. Celebrate when you can, grieve when you need to.
:   [Burnout][thirdbit-burnout] is an occupational hazard for everyone trying to
    make meaningful change, in part because we get so used to doing things on
    our own at the start that we don't share the load even when there are people
    to share it with.  Not all of your allies will become your friends, but
    those who do will be able to share your victories and commiserate with your
    defeats like no one else.

If you cannot be brave---and it is often hard to be brave---be kind.
