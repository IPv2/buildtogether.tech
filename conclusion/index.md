We have come a long way since we talked about crunch mode and how to run a meeting
in <span x="important"></span>.
Using feature branches,
triaging issues,
designing software so that it can be tested,
basing our opinions on the best available research,
knowing your rights---good developers do all of these things,
and I hope that understanding them will help you become better at your craft.

I also hope that your journey won't stop here.
Pervasive surveillance,
online harassment,
radicalization,
and the concentration of wealth and power in a few unaccountable hands (or algorithms):
our industry has fueled them all,
and if you think that being a programmer makes you immune to the fallout,
think again.
None of us can fix this alone;
if you have learned a little from this book or your course about how to work well with others,
then I hope you will choose to use it to make the world a slightly better place.

Contributions to this book are welcome,
from errata and minor improvements to entirely new sections and chapters,
and everyone whose work is incorporated will be acknowledged.
If you'd like to join us,
please file an issue or submit a pull request in [our GitHub repository][bst-repo],
or see the contributors' guide (<span x="contributing"></span>) for more information.
