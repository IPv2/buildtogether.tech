## Audience

Every lesson should be written with specific learners in mind.  These three
[personas][t3-personas] are ours:

-   Tanesya is in the third year of a four-year computer science degree. She worked
    on several volunteer projects in high school and through her mosque, but the
    "Introduction to Software Engineering" course she's about to take will be her
    first semester-long team project at university. This guide will help her and
    her teammates figure out what to do when.

-   Ahmadou worked as an illustrator for several years before doing an intensive
    14-week conversion course to become a JavaScript developer. He has a lot of
    experience working in teams to meet deadlines, but is still often bewildered
    by the tools, jargon, and culture of programming. This guide will help him
    figure out what his new colleagues think is "normal".

-   Sharla teaches JavaScript at Tanesya's college and for the conversion course
    that Ahmadou went through. They taught the "Introduction to Software
    Engineering" class last semester, and were disappointed by how much time
    they and their students wasted. This guide will help them give more
    structure to the next offering and set more realistic expectations.

Like these three personas, readers should:

-   Be able to write multi-page programs in Java, Python, JavaScript, or some
    other modern programming language.

-   Be able to create static web sites using HTML and CSS.

-   Know how to use [Git][git] to save and share files. (It's OK not to know
    [the more obscure commands][git-man-page-generator].)

## Topics

Life is short and your project is even shorter, so this book focuses on the
handful of tools and techniques that will help you the most in the short and
medium term:

-   How to work effectively in a small team when you are constantly being
    interrupted by other tasks like the homework for your other courses.

-   What tools you should use to build, test, deploy, and describe software
    in less time and with less pain.

-   How to design a program (or a set of related programs) that will take
    several weeks to write.

-   How a few simple changes in your study habits will enable you to learn more
    and more quickly.

-   What legal rights you have to the software you create as a student (and on
    the job).

-   What we actually know about software development and why we believe it's
    true.

-   What to do when things go wrong.

The approach draws on a modified version of [Dobzhansky's Rule][dobzhansky]:

> *Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.*

{: .continue}
All of the hard problems in software engineering stem from the fact that human
beings aren't robots. We think and feel, and we do those things in certain ways.
Our mental capacity is limited, which means we have to design programs so that
they will fit into the space between our ears. We learn and work better when we
are doing something that helps us meet our personal goals, which means our
projects will be more successful if we take motivation into account. And as we
learn more, the best way for us to learn changes in predictable ways, so how we
are taught should change too.

## Acknowledgments

This book is dedicated to [Marian Petre][petre-marian], who taught me how to
think about how programmers think and work.  I would also like to thank David
Graf for [doi2bib][doi2bib] and Alexandra Elbakyan for Sci-Hub; this book would
have been much harder to write without their generosity and idealism.
