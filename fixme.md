## Intellectual Property

I asked:

1. Who has what rights to the software that undergrad students produce for courses at your institution? (I'm asking it this way instead of asking "who owns it?" because it appears that at some institutions, both the student and the school have some rights.)

2. What about software that grad students produce during their research?

3. Where and how did you find this out and how sure are you of your answers?

Prof. Joanne Atlee (University of Waterloo)

That's easy.  At Waterloo, the inventor is the owner (unless work is done by an
employee as an "assigned task" in the course of administrative activities). And
the university has a free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable license to copy and
use the work in support of teaching and research activities (but not to
commercialize or distribute outside of the university community).

This applies to

1.  software that undergraduates write
2.  research/software produced by graduate students during their research
3.  Policy 73.  I am very confident in my answers.  I teach this material to CS students.

Prof. Kelly Blincoe (University of Auckland)

Students at the University of Auckland maintain their own IP unless they
specifically sign it over.

We have an IP document which explains things in legal jargon:
https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/the-university/how-university-works/policy-and-administration/research/conduct/intellectual-property-created-by-staff-and-students-policy.html

I became aware of this because of my involvement in a course that has
undergraduate students work with industry partners. Unless the industry partner
negotiates an IP agreement, then the students maintain ownership over the
products they produce. Though, the industry partners maintain ownership of the
IP that they bring as well, so typically there is a joint ownership.

Prof. Davide Fucci (Blekinge Technical College)

I have asked around, and the short answer to Q1 and Q2  is "the student, unless otherwise stated."

Prof. Reid Holmes (University of British Columbia)

Grad students and faculty have joint ownership of their inventions.  Undergrads
own their solutions, but many courses add course licenses to prevent them from
posting their solutions online as they are often to larger projects that persist
between terms. I'll admit to doing this myself

This is an awkward space, but in my course none of the implementations are
really original materials so it isn't like anyone could claim them as novel IP
anyways.

For courses that have open-ended projects though students own their IP and are
encouraged to continue them after the course is over / publish them as they
desire.

The university IP office has pretty robust materials for these things

Prof. Andreas Stefik (University of Nevada Las Vegas)

1.  At UNLV, it's the students.

2.  This depends on how they were funded. Federal law in the U.S. has different
    rules for different things. For example, if it's done under an NSF grant,
    the university claims they own it, although my understanding is this gets
    tricky. States have rules too, which are also tricky. If they are funding
    themselves, they own it all.

3.  Been talking to our commercialization office... I'm pretty sure and have
    looked at the actual laws/policies myself.

Prof. Igor Steinmacher (Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná)

1.  Here it is like this, institution and school have rights. The supervisor can
    also have a share and, if a company is involved, an agreement needs to be
    made up front.  Usually, when no company is involved, we have a 1/3 each
    division.

2.  Again, depends. On grad school this is usually ruled by an agreement among
    all parties involved. It may be the case in which a company will hold the
    rights; the most common is having shares including student, institution,
    supervisor and company.

3.  We have a department responsible for this relationship with companies and IP.

Prof. Christoph Treude (University of Adelaide)

This depends on whether there was any agreement signed with the industry partner
that grants the industry partner rights over the student-created IP. If there
is, we would need to look at the terms of that agreement.
 
It also depends on whether there was any co-authoring of the code by the
industry partner, in which case the industry partner may have rights as a joint
owner.
 
If the students wrote the code themselves and if there is no any agreement with
the industry partner, students own the IP that they create and are free to
choose how they deal with the source code. If the students would like to pursue
commercial opportunities for the IP, they can (but, unlike staff, are under no
obligation to) contact Adelaide Enterprise. If they are happy to release it open
source, that is up to them.
